        category="Lint"
        priority="10"
        summary="Baseline Applied"
        explanation="Lint can be configured with a &quot;baseline&quot;; a set of current issues found in a codebase, which future runs of lint will silently ignore. Only new issues not found in the baseline are reported.&#xA;&#xA;Note that while opening files in the IDE, baseline issues are not filtered out; the purpose of baselines is to allow you to get started using lint and break the build on all newly introduced errors, without having to go back and fix the entire codebase up front. However, when you open up existing files you still want to be aware of and fix issues as you come across them.&#xA;&#xA;This issue type is used to emit an informational-only warning if any issues were filtered out due to baseline matching. That way, you don&apos;t have a false sense of security if you forgot that you&apos;ve checked in a baseline file.">

        id="LintBaselineFixed"
        severity="Hint"
        message="17 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with `android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true`. Unmatched issue types: HardcodedText (5), MissingApplicationIcon, Overdraw, ScopedStorage (2), SetTextI18n (8)"

        priority="10"
        summary="Baselined Issues Fixed"
        explanation="If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)">

    <issue
        id="ScopedStorage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE no longer provides write access when targeting Android 11+, even when using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="8"
        summary="Affected by scoped storage"
        explanation="Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`). In particular, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` will no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent of `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` instead.&#xA;&#xA;As of Android 13, if you need to query or interact with MediaStore or media files on the shared storage, you should be using instead one or more new storage permissions:&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`&#xA;* `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_AUDIO`&#xA;&#xA;and then add `maxSdkVersion=&quot;33&quot;` to the older permission. See the developer guide for how to do this: https://developer.android.com/about/versions/13/behavior-changes-13#granular-media-permissions&#xA;&#xA;The `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can be used to manage all files, but it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.&#xA;&#xA;To learn more, read these resources: Play policy: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-help Allowable use cases: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-usecases"

        id="Overdraw"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Possible overdraw: Root element paints background `#ADD8E6` with a theme that also paints a background (inferred theme is `@style/Theme.Aroma`)"
        category="Performance"
        priority="3"
        summary="Overdraw: Painting regions more than once"
        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead."
